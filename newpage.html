	<h1> This is a new page!</h1>

	<p> This page was created as my very first example on how we can link one page to another using a hyperlink. After this, I was able to link my <a href="https://twitter.com/brynnerh_" > Twitter </a> and my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brynnerh_" > Instagram </a> pages so do check them out! If you'd like to go back to the previous page, simply click "main page" on the top left corner or click <a href="index.html"> here. </a> </p>
